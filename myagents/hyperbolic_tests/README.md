the problem is the succint description of bid:12

A button is represented by a bid which is unique to wob. 
And there is a bounding box which indicates where it is on the page but there is no specificaiton of what and how the page looks. Very vague. Not enough for person or LLM to make decision

If there is a standardized formant then can SFT adn FT. 


Pointless. not worth running miniwob. Too mcuh work to reformat the data
